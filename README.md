# Colonial Warfare
***The CW Project*** is meant to prove that CSS can do the things that a normal strategy game could do. Sure, of course it uses JS to operate the movement and variables but the overall designs are in CSS. A normal strategy game wold se an engine or C++ but I wanted to do something different. It is still in the Development Stage and is still has a lot of work to go, but you can always check in here. As of right now without Node.js, it works like a hotseat multiplayer.

**Current Setting**: It is the year 1600, you have the option to play as one of 4 nations: ***England***, ***France***, the ***Netherlands***, or ***Spain***. Each nation has its own advantages and disadvantages that can make the game easy or hard from the start. Conquest is the key to victory, conquer all colonies to win the game of ***Colonial Warfare***!

**Future Ambitious Plans** 
- implement Node.js (Multiplayer update)
- disable player input on other players turn (Multiplayer update)
- add more units (coming in next big update)
